# Weekly Task 3: accounts.py & accounts2.py

The program ``accounts.py`` reads in a 10 character account number and outputs
the account number with the first 6 characters replaced with Xs.

The program ``accounts2.py`` reads in an account number of any length and outputs
the account number with characters replaced wth Xs based on following assumptions:

1. If the account number is 1 character in length the output will be X.
2. If the length of the account nunber is greater than 1 and less than 10 characters,
   the program will output the account number with at least half of the characters replaced with Xs.
3. If the length of the account number is 10 or more characters, the program will output the account number with all but the last four digits with replaced with Xs.
