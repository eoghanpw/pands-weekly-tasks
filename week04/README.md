# Weekly Task 4: collatz.py

This program prompts the user to input any positive integer and outputs a list of successive values where each value is obtained from the previous value as follows:

    1. If the previous value is even, the next value is one half of the previous value.
    2. If the previous value is odd, the next value is 3 times the previous value plus 1.

The program ends when the next value calculated is one.
